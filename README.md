# react-hooks-toolkit

Commonly used custom react hooks in one place.

### Getting started
#### Compatibility
Your project needs to use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) 16.8 or later.

#### Installation
```bash
$ npm i @knightburton/react-hooks-toolkit
```
or
```bash
yarn add @knightburton/react-hooks-toolkit
```

### Usage
Here's an example of basic usage:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      // TODO: put example here
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Development
Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two terminal tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.
```bash
# Assume that you are in the project main folder
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.
```bash
# Assume that you are in the project main folder
$ cd example
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
